# Code-to-Learn

Hands-on machine learning and statistics experiments to build intuition through coding from scratch.

## Overview
This repository is a personal study project designed to deepen my understanding of machine learning and statistical modeling through **hands-on coding from scratch**.  
It is structured into two main folders:
- **ml_scripts** – Machine Learning models and experiments
- **stats_scripts** – Statistical concepts and simulations

Unlike typical repositories that aim to optimize models or showcase polished results, **the goal here is experimentation and intuition building**.  
I explore how models behave under different scenarios by changing parameters, modifying synthetic datasets, or altering algorithm internals.

All scripts and notebooks are originally created by me — either fully written or heavily adapted based on my own understanding, often including:
- Unique visualizations
- Custom diagnostic measures
- Internal dynamics exploration

## Why This Repository?
- To **understand** models, not just use them.
- To **observe** how slight changes in data or model design impact behavior.
- To **build a strong intuition** behind ML and statistical principles.
- To **experiment freely** without focusing on achieving "best performance" metrics.

## Notes
- Models are applied mostly on **synthetic data**.
- Focus is on **clarity, intuition, and flexibility** over performance.
- The repository encourages **modifying** the code, **changing parameters**, and **observing behavior** as a learning exercise.
